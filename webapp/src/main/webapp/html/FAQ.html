</nav><h3 id="What">What is I2P-Bote?</h3>
<p>A peer-to-peer email program designed to protect your privacy.</p>

<p>I2P-Bote is an end-to-end encrypted, network-internal, fully
decentralized (serverless) e-mail system. It supports different
identities and does not expose e-mail headers. Currently, it is
still alpha software. It can be accessed via web console, and it
has IMAP and SMTP support, so bote-mails can be read and written by
regular email clients. It is planned to guarantee additional
anonymity by providing a high-latency transport option. All
bote-mails are automatically end-to-end encrypted, so that there's
no need to set up e-mail encryption (though the option does exist),
and bote-mails will be authenticated automatically. As it is
decentralized, there is no e-mail server that could link different
e-mail identities as communicating with each other (profiling):
Even the nodes relaying the mails will not know the sender and
apart from sender and receiver, only the end of the high-latency
mail tunnel and the storing nodes will know to whom (anonymous
identity) the mail is destined. The original sender can have gone
offline, long before the mail becomes available on the other side.
This adds on the degree of anonymity that can be reached with
I2P-Bote. For those who do not want high delays: All these settings
are be user-adjustable, so each user decides on how much anonymity
he wants.</p>

<h3 id="Name">Why is it named I2P-Bote?</h3>
<p>Bote is the German word for messenger.</p>

<h3 id="Why">Why I2P-Bote?</h3>
<p>Because it's cool. And because I2P was lacking a decentralized
e-mail service, and seeing the creation of such as an opportunity
to improve on neglected anonymity aspects, it was decided to add an
optional high-latency transport. You can use a normal e-mail
account and end-to-end encrypt your mails, but they are still not
anonymous. You can use anonymous server-bound e-mails, yet they are
not automatically end-to-end encrypted.</p>

<p>Or you can use I2P-Bote in which your mails are anonymous and
<em>automatically</em> end-to-end-encrypted.</p>

<p>In contrast to standard e-mail systems there is no need to setup an
additional key management application. Everything you need is
already there.</p>

<p>But despite it being simple and easy to use, it still offers
military grade encryption and options for extremely strong
anonymity.</p>

<h3 id="Sending">What happens with an email after I click 'Send'?</h3>
<p>It is encrypted and stored on other I2P-Bote participants'
computers. From there, it is delivered to the recipient when they
check their email.</p>

<h3 id="RandomPeople">Wait a minute, all email I send is saved on some random
person's hard drive? That sounds like a really dumb idea!</h3>
<p>All they see is garbage data because it is encrypted with
"military-grade" encryption. Only you and the recipient know what
is in the email. Additionally, if you send the email with relays
enabled, it is not even possible to tell who sent it.</p>

<p>Between this and using an email account with a
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/12/07/schmidt_on_privacy/">company
that doesn't respect your privacy</a>, over an internet line that
<a href="http://www.eff.org/issues/nsa-spying">is being spied on by
shady agencies</a>, which would you say is more trustworthy?</p>

<h3 id="HowItWorks">How does it work exactly?</h3>
<p>See the <a href="userGuide.jsp#Technical-Concept">'Technical Concept'</a>
section of the <a href="userGuide.jsp">User Manual</a>.</p>

<p>In short: I2P-Bote nodes form a P2P-network, relaying mail packets
for one another and storing them into a DHT.</p>

<h3 id="NothingToHide">Why would I use it? I have nothing to hide&hellip;</h3>
<p>Because you wouldn't go out to the street naked either, would you?</p>

<p>Well, maybe you would. But the point is, sometimes you want private
e-mail communication to be secret and untraceable and not let the
whole world know when you say what to whom.</p>

<p>And sometimes you simply want to communicate fully anonymously with
others.</p>

<p>Therefore I2P-Bote is the ideal tool, giving you a hell lot of
protection while preserving a great deal of flexibility.</p>

<p>It aims at providing professional military grade security and
n00b-proof usability: you can have really paranoid settings, where
it takes a mail an eternity to arrive; or have faster communication
and still enjoy very high anonymity.</p>

<p>You decide - easily with a click of your mouse.</p>

<h3 id="GPG">What about <a href="http://www.pgp.com/">PGP</a> and
<a href="http://gnupg.org/">GPG</a>?</h3>
<p>PGP and GPG let you encrypt email and send it through your existing
email account. They offer strong encryption, but they only encrypt
the email text, not the headers, which means the subject line, your
computer name, and other information is not secure.</p>

<p>Another privacy issue is that PGP/GPG cannot prevent anybody from
finding out who is talking to whom.</p>

<p>I2P-Bote, in contrast, encrypts everything but the recipient's
Email Destination. (In fact even the recipient's destination is
only visible to nodes who do not know who the sender of the mail
was.) It also has the ability to send an email through several
relays (similar to
<a href="http://mixmaster.sourceforge.net/">Mixmaster</a>), so nobody can
find out who is sending email to whom.</p>

<h3 id="UsingGPG">Can I still use GPG/PGP with I2P-Bote?</h3>
<p>Of course. Either have GPG encrypt your e-mail's text before
pasting it into the I2P-Bote mail composition field, or use a mail
app with GPG support.</p>

<h3 id="Susimail">How does it compare to Susimail?</h3>
<p>I2P-Bote is better because it has a higher version number. Just
kidding.</p>

<p>I2P-Bote offers more privacy, but Susimail has some features
I2P-Bote doesn't have yet (see below), and Susimail is more
bandwidth-efficient because it doesn't store emails
redundantly.</p>

<h3 id="Comparison">Why is I2P-Bote better?</h3>
<p><em>We</em> think it's better for <em>us</em> (and maybe for you, too;
decide yourself!), than:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mixminion as it is easy to use and as n00b-proof as
we could get it.</p></li>
<li><p>anonymous e-mail services not based on destination
key routing: as those do not deliver built-in end-to-end
encryption.</p></li>
<li><p>centralized services, as the server could go down
(due to attacks, legal problems, lack of funding or interest, &hellip;)
and the server admin has too many means to do profiling.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Safeguards">How is my identity kept safe when I exchange mail with
someone?</h3>
<p>Never is your IP address or even your I2P-destination included in
any e-mail you send.</p>

<p>The high-latency transport counters timing attacks.</p>

<p>End-to-end encryption, per-hop encryption, relaying packets for
other nodes, one single packet size* (padding), a constant rate of
sending (test and dummy messages)*, and a rather balanced
incoming/outgoing ratio* counter traffic analysis attacks, and in
combination with per-hop delays, I2P-Bote offers good means against
intersection attacks.</p>

<p>The open source nature of I2P-Bote guarantees that you yourself can
see the implementation and check it for bugs.</p>

<p>*[not yet implemented]</p>

<h3 id="How">How do I use it?</h3>
<p>Read <a href="userGuide.jsp">the manual</a> or see the other questions and
answers here!</p>

<p>If you still have unanswered questions, ask on the forum:
<a href="http://forum.i2p/viewforum.php?f=35">http://forum.i2p/viewforum.php?f=35</a></p>

<h3 id="EmailClients">Can I use an email program like Thunderbird?</h3>
<p>Yes, you can use the e-mail client of your choice, as long as it
supports IMAP and SMTP.</p>

<h3 id="Attachments">Can I send attachments, and what limits are there?</h3>
<p>Yes, attachments are supported as of release 0.2.5. The overall size of
attached files should be kept small, preferably below 500kB.</p>

<h3 id="CreateIdentity">How do I create an email account?</h3>
<p>I2P-Bote calls them Email Identities. You can create one in the
I2P-Bote web interface under the "Identities" link. The reason why
it's not called an account is that there is no provider like GMail
or GMX. You alone hold the (cryptographic) keys to the Email
Identity.</p>

<p>When you create an Email Identity, I2P-Bote generates a string of
numbers and letters called an Email Destination. This is the
address you can be reached at.</p>

<p>Example: <code>wsq-8u5bTWbaOsrS0JuXRKL-RsbTkckV4W7u2mIu0Yrlfetixq1F~03CArnvbd6tDWwjPHYEuoKyWqwxplSdix</code></p>

<h3 id="EmailDestination">What's an Email Destination? What about email addresses?</h3>
<p>Email destinations (aka bote dests) are between 86 and 512
characters long, depending on the type of encryption. Support for
easy-to-remember, user-chosen addresses is planned for the near
future.</p>

<p>The e-mail identities consist of public and private keys, as well
as a name the user chooses for it. The public part is your e-mail
destination, your pseudonymous identity. And one real user can have
more than one of those identities. They serve for addressing mails
to certain users - therefore it is referred to as a
'destination' or short 'dest' - as well as for encrypting
the mails for them. Hence, your e-mail destination is the key
others use in order to encrypt mails which they send to you, and in
order to verify the authenticity and integrity of mails they
receive from you.</p>

<p>It is safe to give your e-mail destination to anybody you want to
get e-mails from.</p>

<p>It is important to distinguish between the mail dest and the router
id! Your I2P-Bote mail identity is not related to your I2P-Bote
router/node id, which is used for I2P-Bote nodes to contact each
other and this way for the Bote network.</p>

<p>If you have problems with your I2P-Bote app – in the highly
unlikely case it should be necessary – you can tell your I2P-Bote
router id in irc2p, I2P's IRC channels, or the forum or manually
add other peer's id's in order to connect, though until now this
has never been necessary.</p>

<p>It is <b>not linked to your IP</b>. Nonetheless, do not relate your
I2P-Bote router id with your I2P-Bote mail dests since this might
destroy the additional anonymity I2P-Bote itself generates!</p>

<h3 id="AddressLength">Why are the e-mail addresses so long?</h3>
<p>In I2P-Bote every mail is (automatically) encrypted. In order not
to require you to exchange an e-mail address <b>and</b> a long key,
we simply made that key the address. This comes with two additional
benefits: You won't have to worry if an e-mail address is already
taken or not (at least not if you do not send or receive e-mails to
or from the internet) and you don't need a key management app
apart, for taking care of your keys.</p>

<p>It is safe to give away this key, as it is only the public key
which everybody may know about without compromising your e-mails'
secrecy.</p>

<p>Using the ECC encryption as option will yield shorter e-mail
destination keys.</p>

<h3 id="AddressBook">But I cannot remember those long destinations&hellip;</h3>
<p>That's what the integrated address book is there. Once you have
become more acquainted with I2P-Bote, you will appreciate the
built-in encryption and authentication, which can only be achieved
using cryptographic keys.</p>

<p>Again, the alternative would be to have short and easy addresses
<b>plus</b> a long key for encryption and authentication,
<b>and</b> to rely on some authority to map the e-mail addresses to
some anonymous recipient.</p>

<h3 id="MultipleIdentities">What's the point of using multiple mail identities?</h3>
<p>I2P-Bote is not an instant messenger, so you can have several
identities without having to keep many tunnels open. Only for
fetching requests you'd use up more resources but at the same time
provide more cover for others.</p>

<p>Now, imagine you communicate with your friends unobservedly (see:
data retention laws) via I2P-Bote, and want to quickly send out a
mail that you'll be meeting each other in a different location
tonight. Then, you need no super-anonymity and can renounce mail
routes and delays. Your friends, on the other hand, would want to
have a shorter check interval, so they will receive the mail in
time. Yet you still want super high anonymity for some of your
other communications - that's where a different mail identity with
mail routes, delays and long check intervals comes in handy.</p>

<h3 id="EncryptionTypes">Which encryption type is best?</h3>
<p>256-bit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_cryptography">ECC</a>
produces short and handy Email Destinations, and it is considered
stronger than 2048-bit ElGamal.</p>

<p>521-bit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_cryptography">ECC</a>
is stronger than 256-bit ECC, but it makes Email Destinations
longer.</p>

<p>2048-bit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElGamal">ElGamal</a>
produces even longer Email Destinations, and it is the
cryptographically weakest of the three options. However, ElGamal is
better researched than ECC, which makes it less likely that there
is an unknown weakness in ElGamal than in ECC.</p>

<h3 id="Algorithms">What algorithms are used for symmetric encryption, and
for hashing?</h3>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES-256</a>
in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operation#Cipher-block_chaining_.28CBC.29">
CBC</a> mode and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">SHA-256</a>.</p>

<h3 id="AntiSpam">Are there any anti-spam measures?</h3>
<p>I2P-Bote does no active spam filtering, but the fact that mass
emails have to be sent individually should discourage spammers.
Another line of defense is
<a href="http://www.hashcash.org/">HashCash</a> which is supported at the
protocol level and may be implemented in a future version if spam
becomes a problem.</p>

<h3 id="HTML">How about HTML or styled text?</h3>
<p>The webinterface does not render HTML.</p>

<h3 id="Persistence">How long are emails kept around?</h3>
<p>Emails are available for 100 days after they have been sent. Emails
that have not been downloaded by then are deleted.</p>

<p>Emails you have received stay on your local machine until you
delete them.</p>

<h3 id="DoIdentitiesExpire">When do Email Identities expire?</h3>
<p>Never.</p>

<h3 id="Gateways">Can I send email to, and receive email from normal
internet email servers?</h3>
<p>No, but this is being worked on.</p> 
<!-- Yes. You can both send and receive mails to/from ordinary internet e-mail accounts -->

<h3 id="Postman">Can I send email to, and receive email from postman's
traditional I2P mail accounts?</h3>
<p>No, but this too is being worked on.</p> 
<!-- Yes. You can both send and receive mails to/from some_name@mail.i2p addresses -->

<h3 id="Know">What does it mean when Know is x'ed for a mail in my
inbox?</h3>
<p>When the sender's destination is not known locally the mail is
marked by an x in the “Know” column or by putting “{UNK}” before
the sender's address in IMAP.</p>

<p>This means that you have no proof this user is really who he claims
to be, in his user name. Of course, if the signature is valid, you
know he possesses the destination key with which the mail was
signed, and that the mail content is from that person. But you
cannot rely on the short name here. In case you had gotten a mail
from a user with this name before, you cannot be sure it is the
same user this time, even if the signature is valid. In this case
you must compare the destination keys or add them to your
addressbook. A user not locally known, is not necessarily evil, but
you shouldn't trust it's the user you might think it is. But, if
verified against locally stored keys, you know it's the same user
when you receive another mail from him and “Know” has a green
check.</p>

<h3 id="Terms">What do “BktPfx”, “Distance” and “Locked?” mean?</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>BktPfx = BucketPrefix</p></li>
<li><p>Distance: the distance of an I2P-Bote node to your
own node in keyspace</p></li>
<li><p>Locked: If a node is not reachable for whatever
reason, it is marked as locked, plus the time it has been found
unreachable.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Anonymous">What can I do to be more anonymous?</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Don't send identifying information about you! (name, address,
photos, geographic location, time zone, age, sex, websites, login
names, I2P router id, I2P-Bote id, Files that contain author
information about you, &hellip;)</p></li>
<li><p>don't send personal information or information that only you can
possess,</p></li>
<li><p>leave I2P-Bote running 24/7,</p></li>
<li><p>use mailroutes with randomized per-hop delays and/or per-hop
fixed send times, [not yet fully implemented]</p></li>
<li><p>use a long check interval,</p></li>
<li><p>use a long local delay for own packets,</p></li>
<li><p>use a big check interval randomization. [not yet implemented]</p></li>
<li><p>suppress the sending of date and time in the e-mails' header,</p></li>
<li><p>suppress translation of markers like “Re:” into another
language,</p></li>
<li><p>watch your language and writing style,</p></li>
<li><p>use different e-mail identities,</p></li>
<li><p>consider discarding e-mail identities after longer periods of
usage,</p></li>
<li><p>&hellip;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This list is not intended to make you paranoid, but to show you where
anonymity can be reduced.</p>

<h3 id="Timestamps">How do I not send timestamps?</h3>
<p>Go to settings and disable sending of timestamps. This will have
the effect that your mail will not contain a date or time of
sending.</p>

<!-- <p>(When using mailroutes, the timestamps are automatically disabled.) [not yet implemented]</p> -->

<h3 id="Backups">How do I migrate my settings and data to another
computer, or back them up?</h3>
<p>I2P-Bote stores all email and other data in the <code>i2pbote</code>
folder. On Windows, that folder can be found at
<code>%APPDATA%\I2P\i2pbote</code>; on Linux, it is
<code>$HOME/.i2p/i2pbote</code>.</p>

<p>To back up or migrate everything, just copy the whole
<code>i2pbote</code> folder.</p>

<p>If you are only interested in your Email Identities, copy the file
<code>identities.txt</code>. For the address book, copy
<code>addressBook.txt</code>.</p>

<h3 id="MailRoutes">What is a <em>mail route</em>?</h3>
<p>See: What does high-latency transport mean?</p>
<!-- <p>(When using mail routes, the timestamps are automatically disabled.) [yet to be implemented]</p> -->

<h3 id="HighLatency">What does high-latency transport mean?</h3>
<p>It means that you can enable an option where e-mail packets are not
sent directly to storing nodes, but are relayed (forwarded) by
other peers (who cannot read the e-mails, as they are encrypted
with several layers and ripped into small parts), who do not send
them on immediately but wait a user-specified time - in case of
sending specified by the sender, in case of receiving specified by
recipient.</p>

<p>Therefore it takes the mail some time to arrive. Thus an attacker
cannot simply run stats on node uptimes (who was connected when)
and times a message was received to be stored (which in a
low-latency environment would be about the time it was sent), in
order to uncover the real life identities behind I2P-Bote e-mail
identities.</p>

<h3 id="Latencies">What latencies are there, and how can they be controlled
(if at all)?</h3>
<p>I2P-Bote is distributed and running on top of the I2P network, so
it takes some time. Speed is not our strength, but we compare well
with other anon mail systems. Without mail routes enabled it takes
3 to 10 minutes from hitting the “Send” button to being displayed
in the receiver's inbox.</p>

<p>If speed is what you want, fully disable mail routes or set them to
the minimum number of hops and minimum per-hop delay you can live
with.</p>

<h3 id="WhyI2P">If I2P-Bote generates its own anonymity, why does it
need I2P?</h3>
<p>I2P-Bote is built on top of I2P mainly for five reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I2P was lacking a decentralized e-mail service and
HungryHobo is an I2P user.</p></li>
<li><p>I2P offers very good anonymity, is mature and
incorporates years of experience.</p></li>
<li><p>So being on top of it, kind of represents an anonymity
fall-back even if there were some crucial bugs in I2P-Bote.</p></li>
<li><p>Flexibility: We want to offer an easy way to
anonymous low-latency e-mail communication as well, with still a
high level of protection.</p></li>
<li><p>I2P with it the many other apps running on top of
it creates a lot of traffic that blends with I2P-Bote traffic.</p></li>
<li><p>Even I2P-Bote relays are thus location-hidden.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="WithoutRoutes">How anonymous/secure is I2P-Bote without mail routes?</h3>
<p>Pretty anonymous and very secure.</p>

<p>It then basically enjoys the same anonymity other apps have on I2P,
the anonymity provided by the I2P router – which is rather strong
anonymity already. However, I2P is a low-latency network, with all
the shortcomings a low-latency network comes with by its very
nature. There are attacks against which I2P cannot protect you or
not protect you very reliably. I2P-Bote does its best to augment
I2P anonymity with its high-latency transport option, which make –
if enabled – I2P-Bote mails <em>paranoidly</em> anonymous.</p>

<h3 id="OpenSource">Is I2P-Bote open source?</h3>
<p>Of course!</p>
